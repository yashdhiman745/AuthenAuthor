This project demonstrates a user authentication and authorization system in React.js built using Vite. It stores user data on a JSON server via Axios, ensuring secure access with private routing.

Features:

User Authentication & Authorization: Allows users to sign up, log in, and access protected routes.
Private Routing: Secured profile pages using React Router's PrivateRoute to ensure only authenticated users can visit certain routes, even if they manually edit the URL.
JSON Server Integration: Stores user data on a mock JSON server, utilizing Axios for handling API requests.
React & Vite: Developed with React.js and Vite for fast build and development.
